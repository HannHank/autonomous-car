# autonomous-car
This is a Project where I will hopefully drive an RC car around autonomously
## About
The Project is based on an Arduino with an GPS, Compass and Gyro. sensor
The coordinations are comming from a Webpage hosted by an Pi which is mounted 
on the car. 

### what is the next thing ? 
The car can now drive around, following a route of coodinations, but the car can't 
avoid obstacles. So I have to add Hultasonic sensors.
